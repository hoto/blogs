In this part of the series we will encrypt the two out of four partitions we created in the previous episode. For encryption we will use https://linux.die.net/man/8/cryptsetup[`cryptsetup`] .

We want to encrypt partitions for our binaries `/dev/sda3` and for our home `/dev/sda4` . You can see the encrypted parts in yellow here:

.Encrypted parts are in yellow.

Let’s encrypt both partitions, you can use same password for both of them.

* `cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda3`
* `cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda4`

.Encrypting the /dev/sda3 where binaries will be stored.

.Encrypting the /dev/sda4 where our home will reside.

Check if both partitions were encrypted:

* `cryptsetup -v isLuks /dev/sda3`
* `cryptsetup -v isLuks /dev/sda4`

.Both partitions were encrypted successfully.

That’s all for this episode. We will setup automatic decryption of both partition after we install fedora in https://medium.com/@AndrzejRehmann/preparing-fedora-26-laptop-with-zfs-and-encryption-fedora-part-4-1fceb9c8428a[`part 4`]. It’s easier that way, as we need to persist crypt key somewhere.
