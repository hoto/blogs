.Fedora 26 in all its beauty

On my Dell 3470 in order to boot from the https://www.lifewire.com/g00/create-bootable-fedora-usb-drive-2202081?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.pl%2F[bootable pendrive] (with https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/[Fedora 26 ISO] image) I have to press F12 when the laptop is booting up. Then when the boot menu shows up select the inserted pendrive.

.Press F12 (it depends on the laptop) when laptop is booting up and select the inserted pendrive (I’m using UEFI BOOT).

.Click on the “Try Fedora” and the OS will be booted from RAM memory.

* `Try Fedora` will load and boot the OS from RAM memory.
* `Install to Hard Drive` will open an interactive wizard which can quickly format our disk and install Fedora.

We want to create our own partitions and use `cgcrypt` to encrypt them so select `Try Fedora` to boot OS from RAM which will leave the hard drive untouched.

When Fedora loads press the `Win` (super) key and open terminal by typing `terminal`.

> By default Fedora comes with GNOME desktop environment, you can access the Activities view by hovering your mouse to the upper left corner of the screen or pressing `Win` key.

We want to create four partitions on our hard drive and for that we will need to have root permissions. Type `su -` to change to `root` user.

> To change to root user you can type `sudo -i` or shorter `su -`.

Type `lsblk` to see what hard drives and pendrives your laptop sees.

We will use http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/cgdisk.html[`cgdisk`] which is a partition table manipulator. `cgdisk /dev/sda` needs as a parameter the name of the drive — my laptop has only one SSD drive and by default the primary drive is called `sda` (we explained that in part 1). I already have my drive partitioned but I will erase and create same partitions again.

I’m gonna remove my partitions now.

We will create new partitions based on this image (for 256GB SSD drive).

.Type size 256M for our first EFI partition

.Use EF00 (E-F-zero-zero) as partition type which is a code for EFI.
image::011.png[]

> Partition types (but not all of them) can be seen by typing l (that’s small L) instead of the partition code and hitting enter, you would see a list like the one below. EF00 is EFI System.

Leave the `partition name` blank (press enter) and we should have our first partitions created.

.New EFI partition is created.

Now select the lowest `free space` to start creating new partition from there, after the previously created `EFI System` partition.

.Type 1024 as partition size.
image::014.png[]

.Type 8300 as partition code.

.Linux 1024M partition created

Create the third partition with `20G` size and `8304` partition code.

Create fourth partition which will end `9M` from the end of the disk. So instead of providing a size (which would be about `217.1G` in my case) we want the partition to end `9M` from the end. To do that type `-9M` when asked for the partition size. Partition code is `BF01` which stands for ZFS.

.Instead of typing partition type use “-9M” to indicate that the partition should end 9M from the disk end.

.BF01 stands for ZFS

.ZFS partition is created

.Last partition is created so we can now write all partitions to disk.
image::023.png[]

After you create ZFS partition select `[ Write ]` which will write all partitions to disk permanently. Then exit with `[ Quit ]`.

Confirm partitions were created on `/dev/sda` disk by typing `lsblk`.

.Four partitions were written to sda disk.

This concludes this episode. We have now four partition and can now encrypt two of them in https://medium.com/@AndrzejRehmann/preparing-fedora-26-laptop-with-zfs-and-encryption-encryption-part-3-1c32f4c9c013[part 3].
