.Click on the “Install to hard Drive” to open up a wizard.

In this episode we will install fedora on the partitions we created in previous parts of this series.

Press `Win` key to open up the activity window and open installation wizard from the left menu — `install to hard Drive`.

Chose your language and click `continue`. Select `time & date` then click on `installation destination` to select your disk.

.Click on “installation destination”.

.Select your drive and use “Custom” configuration then click “Done’

Select your drive and from `Storage Configuration` choose `custom` to manually select partitions allocation. For two encrypted partitions you will need to provide your password which you used before to encrypt them.

Using the table below select the partition types.

.Partition table for my 256G SSD drive.

For `20G` partition:

* Decrypt using password you used before
* Format using `XFS`
* Use `/` mount point

For 1024MB partition:

* Format using `XFS`
* Use `/boot` mount point

For `256G` partition

* Format using `EFI` System Partition
* Use `/boot/efi` mount point

Leave the fourth `~217.1G` partition alone for now as `ZFS` is not available by default (because of the licence incompatibility issues between Linux kernel and ZFS) and we will install `ZFS` later on.

> Even though ZFS is open source and free it’s license prohibits it being part of Linux kernel. If you want to use ZFS you have to install it yourself.

Click `Done` and installator will warn you that you didn’t created a `swap` partition. With sufficient memory, I have `16G RAM`, we don’t need swap. Ignore the message and click `Done` once again.

.Ignore this and click “Done” once more.

.Click “Accept Changes”.

Click “Accept Changes” and on next screen “Begin Installation”.

.Click “Begin Installation”.

While Fedora is installing let’s setup root password and create our own user.

.Add your user to administrators so you can use sudo.

Follow the convention where your user name is `surname.lastname`. Check the `Make this user administrator` which will add your user to `wheel` group so you can use `sudo` .

Click `Finish configuration` and then go to `Network & Hostname` and setup your hostname to something cool (like `catnipmeadow`) and then click `Quit`.

Reboot your laptop and remove your pendrive from the USB.

You should see a screen asking you for your disk encryption password you provided before (this is the password for the `/dev/sda3` partition where we mounted `/`).

.After reboot type your disk encryption password.

After you provide valid decryption password you should see the login screen.

Log in and you have a running Fedora :)

What is missing is the decryption of the `/dev/sda4` partition and the ZFS.

That’s all for this episode. Next we will use `crypttab` to automatically decrypt `/dev/sda4` partition during OS boot in https://medium.com/@AndrzejRehmann/preparing-fedora-26-laptop-with-zfs-and-encryption-encryption2-part-5-fd98d688fc40[part 5].
