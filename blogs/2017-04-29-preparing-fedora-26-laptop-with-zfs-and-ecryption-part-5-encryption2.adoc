Let’s not forget about the second encrypted partition `/dev/sda4` where we will put our `/home/<user_name>` and `/var/lib/docker` (if you use Docker). We still need to configure https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/crypttab.html[`crypttab`] to decrypt two partitions automatically during boot.

Our current situation is: when the laptop boots up and we provide encryption password it only unlocks the `/dev/sda3` partition. The /dev/sda4 is still encrypted as nothing tried to decrypt it. We will change this in this episode.

You can check that only `/dev/sda3` was decrypted during the OS boot.

....
lsblk
....

When a partition is decrypted you will see the `luks-<UUID>` after the partition id. `/dev/sda4` is not recognized as `luks` so it is not decrypted.

In https://medium.com/@AndrzejRehmann/preparing-fedora-26-laptop-with-zfs-and-encryption-encryption-part-3-1c32f4c9c013[part 3] we encrypted partitions `/dev/sda3` and `/dev/sda4` with some passwords. Those passwords could be different or be the same but it does not matter as `dm_crypt` will only ask for password for `/dev/sda3` where our binaries are stored (it is mounted to `/` ).

So how do we let `dm_crypt` know it should decrypt `/dev/sda4`? To make this happen we will add a crypt key file for the `/dev/sda4` partition which will be stored on the `/dev/sda3` in `/etcd/crypt.d/<key_name>`.

When the laptop boots up, `dm_crypt` will ask us the password for the first partition `/dev/sda3` and then it will lookup the content of a file `/etc/crypttab` (stored on `/dev/sda3` ) and will decrypt all other partitions which are defined in that file. In our case it will just decrypt `/dev/sda4`.

---

First let’s create the keys folder and the key itself.

[source,bash]
....
mkdir /etc/crypt.d
dd bs=515 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/crypt.d/sda4.key
....

This will generate a `2KB` file with random stuff in it.

Next https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption[`add`] that `/etc/crypt.d/sda4.key` to the list of keys (you have available 10 empty key slots) which can decrypt `/dev/sda4` partition. Provide the password which you used to encrypt the partition before.

....
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda4 /etc/crypt.d/sda4.key
....

Check if the key was added.

....
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda4
....

Key slot number `0` is occupied by the password which we used to decrypt the disk in the first place.

Key slot number `1` is the key we just added, the `/etc/crypt.d/sda4.key`. That means that if someone stole that file he could use that key to decrypt your `/dev/sda4` partition. But because that file is stored on the encrypted partition `/dev/sda3` the hacker would have to decrypt that partition first.

---

Now let’s create the `/etc/crypttab` file and put there the path for our newly created decryption key.

`/etc/crypttab` file looks like this:

....
<luks_name> UUID=<luks_UUID> <path_to_key_file>
....

.My current crypttab file.

To get the `<luks_name>` and `<luks_UUID>` of an already opened (decrypted) partition use our favorite command.

....
lsblk
....

.List of all disks and decrypted partitions.

To get the /dev/sda4 partition UUID which is not yet opened use:

....
blkid /dev/sda4
....

.Luks UUID of /dev/sda4 partition.
image::008.png[]

Copy the `UUID` and add an entry to `/etc/crypttab`:

....
vi /etc/crypttab # you can use nano or gedit if you don't like vi
....

.Add an entry to /etc/crypttab.

.Check if /etc/crypttab was saved

---

*Reboot* and check if both partitions were decrypted.

....
lsblk
....

.Both sda3 and sda4 should be decrypted after reboot.
image::011.png[]

Both `/dev/sda3` and `/dev/sda4` should be decrypted after the reboot. You should see the `luks-<UUID>` after the partition name.

You can check that the `/dev/sda4` is encrypted and ZFS formatted.

....
fdisk -l
....

./dev/sda4 is encrypted and ZFS formatted.

That’s all for this episode. Next we will install ZFS and prepare the fourth `/dev/sda4` partition then move our `/home/<user_name>` there so our home files are safe with ZFS in https://medium.com/@AndrzejRehmann/preparing-fedora-26-laptop-with-zfs-and-encryption-zfs-part-5-1e17820b40a4[part 6].
