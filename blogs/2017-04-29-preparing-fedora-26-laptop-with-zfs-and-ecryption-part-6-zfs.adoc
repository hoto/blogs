Before we install ZFS it’s good practice to update the `kernel` first.

[source,bash]
....
su -
dnf update kernel\*
....

.Accept updating kernel.

*Reboot* the machine *if* the kernel was updated.

---

After rebooting install `kernel-devel` and `dkms` by typing:

....
# reboot first if you updated kernel!
dnf install kernel-devel dkms
....

Install ZFS. Go to http://zfsonlinux.org/ and click on `Fedora` which should redirect you to https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Fedora. From there copy and paste:

[source,bash]
....
dnf install http://download.zfsonlinux.org/fedora/zfs-release$(rpm -E %dist).noarch.rpm
gpg --quiet --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-zfsonlinux
....

Install ZFS.

[source,bash]
....
dnf install zfs
....

image::007.png[]

When ZFS installs enable its modules.

[source,bash]
....
systemctl preset zfs-import-cache zfs-import-scan zfs-mount zfs-share zfs-zed zfs.target
....

Confirm ZFS was installed.

[source,bash]
....
dkms status
....

image::010.png[]


Load ZFS.

[source,bash]
....
modprobe zfs
....

image::011.png[]

---

Get the luks partition UUID name of /dev/sda4.

[source,bash]
....
lsblk
....

image::012.png[]

Create ZFS pool on `/dev/sda4` and check if it was created.

[source,bash]
....
zpool create -m none -o ashift=12 -O relatime=on -O compression=lz4 -O xattr=sa <zpool_name> /dev/mapper/luks-<partition_UUID>
zfs list
....

ZFS says we have `209G` of available space which sounds about right.

---

What’s left is to create a ZFS create mountpoints for /`home` and `/var/lib/docker` (if you use Docker).

*Reboot* and log in as *root* by clicking on the `Not listed?` and typing `root` as the user name.

.Click on the “Not listed?”.

.Log in as root.

---

Logged in as root, open terminal and let’s create mountpoint for `/home`.

First Move your `home` to another location as ZFS needs an empty directory to create a mountpoint.

[source,bash]
....
mv /home/<user_name> /home_<user_name>_copy
ls -la /home # make sure it's empty!
....

image::016.png[]

Then remove the the `/home` directory. And create ZFS mountpoint for it.

[source,bash]
....
rm -rf /home
zfs create -o mountpoint=/home <zpool>/home
....

You could leave it at this but I will add two more mountpoints, one for my personal `home` and one for my folder where i keep all of my `projects`. This makes creating and managing ZFS snapshots easier.

[source,bash]
....
zfs create <zpool>/home/andrzej.rehmann
zfs create <zpool>/home/andrzej.rehmann/projects
zfs list
....

.Don’t mind the docker mountpoint, we will add it later.

---

Move back your `home` to `/home/<user_name>` and restore selinux context and put the right ownership on all our files (remember we are root at the moment).

[source,bash]
....
mv /home_<user_name>_copy /home/<user_name>
restorecon -R /home
chown -R <user_name>:<user_name> /home/<user_name>
chmod 700 /home<user_name>
....

image::019.png[]
image::020.png[]

Check if the size of you home pool increased (it should).

....
zfs list
....

image::021.png[]

---

If you don’t use Docker then skip this step.

Create mountpoint for `docker` and restore selinux context

[source,bash]
....
zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/lib/docker <zpool>/docker
restorecon -R /var/lib/docker
....

image::022.png[]

Docker will automatically detect z ZFS file system when you install it.

---

Log out from being a root and log in as you.

.Log out from being a root.
image::023.png[]

After you log in check the size of your zfs pool.

....
zfs list
....

image::024.png[]

We can see that pool `lithiumpool/home` has `38.3M` used space. It means that /home and whatever folder is inside (eg. our `/home/<user_name>`) is stored on a ZFS managed partition `/dev/sda4`.

---

> Never update `kernel` and `zfs` or `dkms` toghether. Update `kernel` last.

....

dnf update --exclude=kernel\*
dnf update
....

---

This is the end of this series. In future posts I would like to talk about how to use ansible to configure your Fedora laptop and how to `git` manage your `home` directory so it’s synchronized between all of your laptops and backed up by github/bitbucket.
