== Microservices failures: underestimating platform complexity

First I would like to point out that this blog is my own private opinion on the subject.

In my career I stumbled upon two scenarios when approaching microservices architecture:

1. Migrating from a monolith by extracting bits from it.
2. Starting fresh - what we call a greenfield project.

When starting fresh the core funcionality does not exist yet (obviously) and it will get distributed across many services - that's why we call it a distributed system.

The most common mistakes when starting a distributed system from scratch are:
